#Web Script Programing 3 - Configurable Dashboard
This web application is my submission for coursework submission 3 for Web Script Programming.

##Brief
This dashboard is primarily aimed at students as a way of keeping track their weekly schedule through the use of small applets within a web browser. This will be fully customisable by the user, from colour schemes to the applets they choose to display.

##Main features
1. A weekly schedule that can be customised to suit a students week. They can set specific hours devoted to a particular task such as a lecture, revision or free time. The content on the dashboard will reflect the task at the current time. If the hour is set to revision, the dashboard will make clear the task that the student should be doing.

2. Users can create reminders for upcoming events such as coursework deadlines or... finish

##Method
This application will be based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To enable web servers easily, I am using NodeJS with modules such as Express. Additionally, a MySQL database will be used. No libraries such as jQuery will be used.
